# Portfolio

## H2 I found this final to be difficult than I expected because it was pretty hard to replicate the wireframe I submitted for UX Design. I was unfamiliar as to how to even create the layouts I created. I had to do alot of research and re-learning just to get the hang of it, and I didn't really finish this portfolio with what I wanted it to look like. I do believe with more practice I can re-create it to the best of my abilities.
